Model Card for Health Metrics Analysis Model
This model analyzes health metrics data (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels, and temperature) to classify a patient's overall health status into three categories: normal, abnormal, or critical. It provides both classification results and detailed clinical analysis of the vital signs.

Model Details
Model Description
The Health Metrics Analysis Model is a multi-class classification system designed to evaluate patient vital signs and determine their overall health status. It processes five key vital measurements (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and body temperature) and classifies the patient's condition into one of three categories: normal, abnormal, or critical. The model also provides detailed clinical analysis of the vital signs, including potential correlations between abnormal readings and possible medical conditions.

Demo: Available as a React web application
Uses
Direct Use
This model is designed for educational and research purposes in healthcare settings. It can be used to:

Analyze patient vital signs and provide an overall health status classification
Identify potential correlations between abnormal vital signs
Suggest possible medical conditions based on vital sign patterns
Provide clinical recommendations for further evaluation
The model is implemented as part of a web application with three main components:

Dataset Generator: Creates balanced training data
Model Trainer: Trains the classification model using neural networks or KNN
Health Predictor: Uses the trained model to analyze new vital sign inputs
Downstream Use
The model could be integrated into:

Electronic health record (EHR) systems for preliminary patient assessment
Remote patient monitoring systems to flag concerning vital sign patterns
Medical education platforms to teach clinical correlation of vital signs
Research studies on vital sign pattern recognition
Out-of-Scope Use
This model is NOT intended for:

Replacing clinical judgment or medical diagnosis
Making treatment decisions without healthcare provider oversight
Emergency medical triage without human supervision
Predicting specific medical conditions with diagnostic certainty
Use in critical care settings without proper medical supervision
Bias, Risks, and Limitations
The model is trained on synthetic data which may not fully represent real-world patient populations
Classification thresholds are based on general medical guidelines and may not account for individual patient factors
The model does not consider patient history, medications, or comorbidities
Results may vary for different demographic groups (age, sex, race) not explicitly modeled in the training data
The model does not account for measurement errors or device calibration issues
Clinical correlations are based on general medical knowledge and not personalized to specific patient contexts
Recommendations
Users should treat model outputs as supplementary information, not definitive medical advice
Healthcare professionals should review all model predictions before making clinical decisions
Regular retraining with diverse, representative data is recommended to minimize bias
Model performance should be monitored across different demographic groups
Implementation should include clear disclaimers about the model's limitations
Users should be trained on proper interpretation of model outputs
How to Get Started with the Model
Use the code below to get started with the model:

```javascript
// Load the trained model
const response = await fetch('/api/model');
const modelData = await response.json();

// For neural network model
const network = new brain.NeuralNetwork();
network.fromJSON(modelData.modelJson);

// For KNN model
const knnModel = new KNNModel(modelData.modelJson.k, modelData.modelJson.distanceMetric);
knnModel.fromJSON(modelData.modelJson);

// Normalize input data
const normalizeData = (value, min, max) => {
  return (value - min) / (max - min);
};

// Prepare input
const input = {
  systolic: normalizeData(120, 90, 200),
  diastolic: normalizeData(80, 60, 120),
  heartRate: normalizeData(75, 60, 180),
  oxygenLevel: normalizeData(98, 70, 100),
  temperature: normalizeData(36.6, 36, 41)
};

// Make prediction
const result = network.run(input);
// Or for KNN: const result = knnModel.run(input);

// Get most likely status
const mostLikelyStatus = Object.keys(result).reduce((a, b) => 
  result[a] > result[b] ? a : b
);

console.log(`Predicted status: ${mostLikelyStatus}`)```;

Training Details
Training Data
The model is trained on a balanced dataset of synthetic health metrics data. The dataset contains equal proportions of normal, abnormal, and critical records to prevent class imbalance issues. Each record includes:

Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)
Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
Heart rate (bpm)
Oxygen level (%)
Body temperature (Â°C)
Status labels for each vital sign (normal, abnormal, critical)
The dataset is generated using medically appropriate ranges for each vital sign category:

Normal: Values within healthy physiological ranges
Abnormal: Values moderately outside healthy ranges
Critical: Values significantly outside healthy ranges
Training Procedure
Preprocessing
Data normalization: All vital sign values are normalized to a 0-1 range using min-max scaling
Feature extraction: Raw vital signs are used directly as features
Label encoding: Health status is encoded as a multi-class classification problem

Evaluation
Testing Data, Factors & Metrics
Testing Data
The model is evaluated on a held-out portion (10%) of the generated dataset that was not used during training.

Factors
Evaluation is disaggregated by:

Health status category (normal, abnormal, critical)
Individual vital sign ranges
Metrics
Accuracy: Overall classification accuracy across all classes
Confusion matrix: To evaluate misclassification patterns
Class-specific precision and recall: To evaluate performance on each health status category
Results
Summary
Overall accuracy: Typically 85-95% depending on configuration
Performance is generally balanced across classes due to the balanced training data
KNN tends to perform better on larger datasets with clear decision boundaries
Neural networks may capture more complex patterns with sufficient training
